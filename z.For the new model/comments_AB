Regarding the PV issue, the "missing demand" can be acccounted for by a combination of the heat pump's electricity demand (this was the main cause) and the storage.  As far as I can tell, there are no problems with the model - it's just that the electricity demand of the heat pump is not listed in the output files.

There's an issue with the storage being labelled as "Cool" instead of "Heat" in the output files. This seems to be a problem with the output printing, as the results are correctly indicated in Aimms.  To fix this, I just removed the cooling demand column from demand_data.csv in the case_data folder, which was set to zero anyway.

I'm not sure what data the scenarios set should ultimately contain. Right now it is hardcoded in the Ehub Modelling Tool with '1', but I assume this should be changed.

Changed the index of the scenarios set to "z" instead of "s", because s is already used as a secondary index for the time set.

The parameter "Storage_init" is undefined

The new code is being added in a single M file located at: src\generate_model\augment_ams\enable_ancillary_services
